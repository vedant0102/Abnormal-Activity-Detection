Introduction
The Abnormal Activity Detection System aims to detect suspicious activities, such as shoplifting, robbery, and break-ins, using Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras. The system utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze real-time video footage and alert shop owners about potential security threats.
Problem Statement
Shoplifting, robbery, and break-ins have been persistent issues for shop owners, leading to financial losses and safety concerns. Traditional security measures, such as Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) alarm systems, have limitations in detecting suspicious behavior effectively. The Abnormal Activity Detection System addresses these challenges by leveraging CCTV cameras and advanced algorithms to automate the detection process.
System Overview
The Abnormal Activity Detection System consists of the following components:
CCTV cameras: The system utilizes existing CCTV cameras installed in shops to capture real-time video footage.
Computer Vision Algorithms: The system employs computer vision techniques, including motion detection, object detection, and behavior analysis, to identify abnormal activities.
Machine Learning Models: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are trained on a dataset of categorized images to recognize specific abnormal activities, such as shoplifting, robbery, and break-ins.
Alert System: When suspicious activity is detected, the system sends real-time alerts to the shop owner, providing information about the location and type of activity.
Requirements Analysis
The document provides a detailed analysis of the requirements for the Abnormal Activity Detection System. It covers data requirements, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and system specifications.
